PRIVACY POLICY FOR SitUpChair ASBL



Version : 1.0. March 2017



Our commitment to privacy



SitUpChair ASBL (hereafter « SitUpChair », « the company », « us », « we ») knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate you trusting that we will do so carefully and sensibly. To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy explaining our practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by SitUpChair. The information below explains our policy regarding your privacy, both online and offline. By visiting our website www.SitUpChair-belgique.be or sharing personal information with SitUpChair via any of its channels (website, chatbot…) you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.



What personally identifiable information is collected by SitUpChair?



When use our applications, or interact with our chatbot with the purpose of getting information about us, you may provide us with personal information (such as name, address, email address, telephone numbers and/or credit/debit card information) that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis for various purposes. These purposes include registering to receive email newsletters or other materials, requesting further information from us about projects and services, making requests, submitting a form on our website, or simply asking a question. We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. We ask for personal information so that we can fulfill your request and return your message. This information is retained and used in accordance with existing laws, rules, regulations, and other policies in force in the European Union.

SitUpChair does not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. If you choose not to provide any of that information, we may not be able to fulfill your request, but you will still be free to browse the other sections of the websites owned and administered by us. This means that you can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself.



The way we use information



When you supply information about yourself for a specific purpose, we use the information for only that purpose (such as to provide the service or information you have requested). For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to receive information, through your personal network. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your request. Similarly, should you decide to share any of your friends’ data (names), it would only be used in the context of the intended request or experience within our site, chatbot or application. You can register with our website if you would like to receive updates on our new projects and services. Information you submit on our website, over the phone, or via our chatbot will not be used for this purpose unless a subscription is created via a form or in accordance with the platform’s policy. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. SitUpChair does not sell, rent, give-away or share its email addresses or other personal contact information with outside sources. SitUpChair also does not send mailings on behalf of other organizations.

Should any material changes be made to the ways in which we use personally identifiable information, SitUpChair will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain consent from you. We will also post the changes to our use of personally identifiable information on our website, applications or chatbots at least 30 days prior to a change.



Our commitment to data security



Personally identifiable information is stored on our server and is not publicly accessible. Further, personally identifiable information is only accessed by SitUpChair’s staff on a "need to know" basis. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Additionally, sensitive data such as debit card numbers are encrypted using SSL and other industry standard measures, to provide an additional level of security.
